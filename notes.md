# Notes

## GQRX

- GQRX does not do AM by default. It requires some tuning to get below 22.0 MHZ. See [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/comments/ksmv9f/cant_listen_to_am_radio_broadcasts_with_nooelec/) and [user report](http://adrianchadd.blogspot.com/2017/06/gqrx-direct-sampling-configuration.html?m=1)

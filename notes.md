# Notes

## GQRX

- GQRX does not do AM by default. It requires some tuning to get below 22.0 MHZ. See [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/comments/ksmv9f/cant_listen_to_am_radio_broadcasts_with_nooelec/) and [user report](http://adrianchadd.blogspot.com/2017/06/gqrx-direct-sampling-configuration.html?m=1)

## NOAA

- [IN NOAA Weather Radio Channels](https://www.weather.gov/nwr/stations?State=IN)
- Bloomington is 162.450 MHz, narrow FM demod

## FM

- Found harmonics for 96.7 (31.94 MHz) and B 96.1 (32.5)

## DMR

- UK equiavlant of P25 (Europe?) fully encrypted in BBC, so not able to listen to it.

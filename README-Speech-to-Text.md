# Investigation of Speech-to-Text Services on P25 Radio Transmissions

## Introduction

P25 is digital radio standard commonly used by emergency services and public service personnel (such as poice, EMS, department of transportation, DNR, etc.) for two-way radio communication. To record these trasnmission we built in previous work [a software defined radio (SDR)](https://github.com/aporlowski/pi-sdr) using inexpensive SDR dongles and a Raspberry Pi.

In this investigation we will investigate the ability of modern AI driven speech-to-text services, such as those provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, to transcribe P25 radio transmissions.

# Investigation of Speech-to-Text Services on P25 Radio Transmissions

## Introduction

P25 is digital radio standard commonly used by emergency services and public service personnel such as poice, EMS, department of transportation, DNR, and more. In this investigation we will investigate the ability of modern AI driven speech-to-text services, such as those provided by cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azure, to transcribe P25 radio transmissions. We have [built a software defined radio (SDR)](https://github.com/aporlowski/pi-sdr) using inexpensive SDR dongles and computers.
